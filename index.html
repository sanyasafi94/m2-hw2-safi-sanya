    <h1>About Sanya Safi</h1>

    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>
      My name is Sanya Safi, a Muslim Pakistani American residing in the suburbs
      of Chicago. I did my undergrad in Applied Psychology from the Univeristy
      of Illinois at Chicago. From the time that I graduated from UIC and
      beginning my Master's, I took a handful of courses through my local
      community college and Coursera on Web and UI/UX Design. Currently I am
      working at a non profit organization that focuses on educating the adult
      Muslim on youth mental health disorders. In my free time, I have begu to
      work on making my crochet hobby into a side hustle and you can find our
      Instagram page here :<a href="https://www.instagram.com/looptoloop.200/"
        >Loop to Loop Crochet</a
      >. Other than that, I spend my time making sure the stray cats in my
      neighborhood are well and fed.

    <h4>Career Goals</h4>
    <p>
      I have a couple of career goals. One is that I want to be able to land a
      job in the Web Design or UI/UX field. I find this field to be very
      interesting and I love how there are options for work from home. The other
      career that I have is to make my crochet business into something I could
      live off of.
    </p>

    <h4>Hobbies</h4>
    <p>
      I am a person who tends to pick up hobbies like they are flowers and, like
      flowers, some of the hobbies wither and cease to exisit in my life. Some
      have shown great resilience and have stayed around in some way or another.
